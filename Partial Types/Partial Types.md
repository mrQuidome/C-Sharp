# Partial Types

Partial types in C# are a language feature that allows the definition of a class, struct, or interface to be split into multiple files. This feature is particularly useful in scenarios where a single type has a large amount of code or when multiple developers are working on the same type in a team environment. By using partial types, the code can be organized and managed more effectively. This primer will cover the basics of partial types, including how to define and use them in your C# projects.

## Understanding Partial Types

A partial type is defined with the `partial` keyword. This keyword indicates that the type definition is not complete in a single location and that other parts of the type may be spread across multiple files. All parts of the partial type must be compiled together to form a single type.

## Key Features

- **Splitting Implementation**: Allows the implementation of a class, struct, or interface to be divided among several files.
- **Code Organization**: Helps in organizing code logically (e.g., separating the UI code from the business logic).
- **Team Collaboration**: Facilitates team collaboration by allowing multiple developers to work on the same class, struct, or interface without causing too many merge conflicts in source control.

## How to Define Partial Types

To define a partial type, you use the `partial` modifier on each part of the type definition. Each part must have the same access modifiers and attributes. Here's an example:

### File 1: MyPartialClass_Part1.cs

```C#
public partial class MyPartialClass
{
    public void MethodPart1()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Method part 1");
    }
}
```

### File 2: MyPartialClass_Part2.cs

```C#
public partial class MyPartialClass
{
    public void MethodPart2()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Method part 2");
    }
}
```

When the application is compiled, `MyPartialClass` will contain both `MethodPart1` and `MethodPart2`, as if they were defined in a single file.

## Restrictions

- All partial-type definitions must be in the same assembly and namespace unless the namespace is explicitly specified in each part.
- If any part of the partial type specifies a base class, then all other parts must agree with that base class. The same rule applies to interfaces.
- Attributes applied to one part of a partial type apply to the entire type.

## Use Cases

- **Large Classes**: Useful for managing large classes, such as Windows Forms or WPF-generated code, by separating designer code from business logic.
- **Team Development**: Enables multiple team members to work on the same class without constant merging, especially when using source control systems.
- **Generated Code**: Works well with automatically generated code. You can keep generated code in one partial class file and write your customizations in another.

## Best Practices

- Use partial classes to enhance readability and maintainability, not as a workaround for overly complex classes. Consider refactoring large classes into smaller, more focused classes where possible.
- Keep logically related members in the same partial file to make the codebase easier to navigate and understand.
- Document the organization of partial types to help team members understand where to find specific functionality within the type.
